What I did to the following set of files to get the lab working:

1. server.c
Added code to initialize ctx with Bob's key file. Then set its cipher list and verify protocols. 
In child process, added code to check the client's certificates, then read from the ssl connection and write back response. 
After written back a response, close the SSL connection with the client. 

2. client.c
Added code to initialize ctx with Alice's key file. Then set its cipher list and options. 
Added code to check the server's certificate, then send 1 message to the server, then read response from the server. 
After receiving the response, close the SSL connection with the server. 

3. util.c, util.h
util.h is the header file of util.c which stores some common methods used by both server and client uses. 
util.h also stores some commonly used values like Bob's common name and email, Alice's common name and email, etc. 
util.c contains code for initializing ctx, destroying ctx, etc.
